# DiscreteStrcutresTermProject
Final Project from Discrete Structures
This project was definitely an interesting one. It made me think about programming in a way that I have never really thought of in the past. I knew about program efficiency from things like games, but I never thought to apply it to my own programs before. Fortunately I was more or less able to take code from other programs I have done in the past to complete this task, with a few tweaks here and there I had the program up and working. I opted to have everything in one large program and have it write to a log file to make things simple for analysis later. The data was not too surprising, as array size increased so did time to sort, with bubble sort being faster at first but slowly gained more time to process falling behind selection sorting. I did have one outlier with bubble sorting in the size five arrays, it did not throw the data too far off and it is easy to tell this is just an anomaly. After running that test again it did fit the mold much better but was not recorded. Overall the project was not a difficult one but it did teach me something, if I were to do this again I would probably run it with larger arrays to get more data to see just how the two methods converge and diverge on each other.
